## API Integration

This project uses an external API to fetch currency exchange rates. You will need to replace `API_KEY` in the code with your own API key. Here's how to integrate the API:

1. **Get API Key**: Sign up on a currency exchange rate API provider (e.g., [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/)).
2. **Replace API Key**: In the codebase, replace `API_KEY` with your actual API key.

```javascript
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';

// Fetch exchange rates

        fetch(`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies/${currency}.json`)
        .then((res) => res.json())//converting to json
        .then((res) => setData(res[currency]))//storing the converted json data in a usestate nopt using the regular variable coz it will not get updated in the UI 
        console.log(data);
```
